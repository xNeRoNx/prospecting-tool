# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
Create a welcoming, inclusive and harassment‑free environment for everyone interacting with the project: issue reporters, contributors, reviewers and community members.

## Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces: repository (issues, PRs, discussions), submitted patches, and any community channels where the project is officially represented. Violations outside these spaces may still affect a participant’s involvement if they impact the project’s safety or reputation.

## Our Standards
### Positive Behaviours
- Showing empathy and respect for differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Using inclusive, gender‑neutral and welcoming language
- Recognising contributions publicly

### Unacceptable Behaviours
- Harassment, intimidation, personal attacks or insults
- Discriminatory language or imagery (including sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia)
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, deliberate provocation, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission
- Threats of violence or encouraging self‑harm

## Reporting
Report concerns or violations via Discord (private message) to: **x_neron_x**.
Include if possible: links, context, timestamps, screenshots. All reports are treated confidentially and only shared with maintainers who need to act.

If you are unsure whether something is a violation, report or ask privately—better to clarify early.

## Enforcement
Maintainers will review and respond in a manner they deem appropriate, consistent and proportionate.

Progressive actions (non‑exhaustive):
1. Informal warning / clarification request
2. Official written warning
3. Temporary interaction limits (e.g. lock conversation, mute in channel)
4. Temporary ban from contribution (time‑boxed)
5. Permanent ban or removal of contributions if harmful

Severe misconduct (e.g. threats, hate speech) may skip directly to stronger actions.

Appeals: A banned individual may send a single appeal after 30 days explaining why behaviour will not recur. Repeated or abusive appeals are ignored.

## Retaliation
Retaliation against reporters or witnesses is itself a violation and will be acted upon.

## Attribution
Derived from and inspired by the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)
with adaptations for project specificity and dual‑language support.

## Updates
This document may evolve.
