  infoTitle: "Prospecting! Tools – Information",
  infoIntro: "This section provides an overview of the available tools and a full list of craftable items with their stats.",
  infoLastUpdate: "Last update",
  infoAuthorNoteTitle: "Author's Note",
  infoAuthorNoteDesc: "This companion project was assembled using data publicly shared on the Prospecting! Discord server, the community wiki (https://prospectingwiki.org). Several internal mechanisms—such as certain multiplier ordering, museum weight scaling placeholders, and some stat interaction assumptions—are based on my own inference where official formulas were unavailable.\n\nIf you notice mistakes, balance changes, missing entries or have better evidence for a formula, please open a GitHub issue or reach out on Discord by pinging x_neron_x. Community feedback helps keep this tool accurate and useful.",
  infoHeaderTitle: "Top Bar (Header)",
  infoHeaderDesc: "The top bar provides quick access to theme appearance changes, language switching, data management, and supporting the creator.\n\nLanguage Switch: Instantly toggle between languages. The URL path updates so you can share a link that opens directly in the selected language.\n\nTheme Switch: Choose from the available color themes to adapt the interface to your preferences or conditions (e.g. a dark background).\n\nSupport Button: Opens a dialog where you can support further development. This helps keep the app ad‑free and funds new features.\n\nTip: Set the language first before sharing the link— the recipient will see the correct version.",
  infoDataManagementTitle: "Data Management",
  infoDataManagementDesc: "Use Data Management to safely save, export and import your progress across devices or share setups with others.\n\nSave Slots: Store multiple snapshots (items to craft, museum slots, equipment, owned materials). Overwrite an existing slot or create a fresh one. Each save contains metadata (name, description, timestamp, version) so you can identify it later.\n\nSelective Export: Choose exactly which data categories to include. Helpful when you only want to share a crafting plan without exposing equipment or material counts. Export either to a downloadable JSON file or generate a shareable URL (compressed + encoded).\n\nImport Preview: Before applying imported data you see a summary (counts per category, metadata) and can selectively enable only the parts you want. Nothing changes until you confirm. This prevents accidental overwrites.\n\nURL Sharing: The Export to URL option copies a link containing compressed state in the hash fragment. Anyone opening it (or pasting the hash) will see an import preview—never an auto‑import—for safety.\n\nAutomatic Backup: Before applying an import or loading a save slot, the current state is copied into the backup slot so you can revert if the result is not what you expected.\n\nWorkflow Tips:\n1. Name saves clearly (e.g. ‘Museum Test Build’).\n2. Use description for context (event bonuses, experiment notes).\n3. Export before risky experiments so you can roll back.\n4. Share URL exports for quick collaboration without moving files.\n5. After importing, review totals before crafting further.\n\nPrivacy Note: Data stays local in your browser unless you explicitly export or share a URL.",
  infoCraftingHeader: "Crafting Tool",
  infoCraftingDesc: "Plan everything you want to build and watch progress in one place.\n\nAdd Items: Press Add Item, pick a card, set how many you want, confirm. Raising the quantity later is usually cleaner than adding the same line twice.\n\nProgress per Line: Each item shows current progress like 3/7. Use the hammer icon to finish just one more piece when you have enough materials. Use the curved back arrow to undo the last piece if you misclicked—its materials return. When progress reaches the total, the item marks itself as done.\n\nMaterials Panel: Shows only what you still need (already finished pieces are ignored). Minimal view gives a lightweight “starter” list (one of each type) to estimate early grind.\n\nFinishing Items: Marking something done (or letting it auto‑complete) removes it from new material needs. Unmarking gives back the remaining materials it had taken.\n\nChanging Quantity: Lowering the number trims extra progress if it was higher. Increasing adds new required pieces.\n\nCan Craft List: Tells you what you can fully finish right now and how many copies with your current materials.\n\nInventory Cleanup: After plans change you can clear unused or zero materials. An empty inventory message appears if nothing was added yet.\n\nTips:\n1. Craft piece by piece to avoid waiting for full sets.\n2. Undo quickly if you clicked by mistake.\n3. Prefer one line with a higher number instead of duplicates.\n4. Use Minimal first to see the entry cost, then switch back.\n5. Keep your owned counts updated for accurate “Can Craft”.",
  infoMuseumTitle: "Museum System",
  infoMuseumDesc: "Curate ores in display cases to unlock global stat multipliers for your equipment.\n\nPurpose: The museum rewards strategic placement of unique ores (one instance of each) by rarity. Higher rarities grant access to stronger effects and higher maximum multipliers. Selecting an optional modifier further boosts the base ore effect depending on its rarity.\n\nSlots & Rarity: Slots are pre‑allocated per rarity (Exotic 1, Mythic 2, Legendary 3, Epic 3, Rare 3, Uncommon 3, Common 3) and appear from rarest to most common for quick top‑down planning. Each slot can hold: (a) one ore, (b) an optional modifier, (c) a weight value you mined for that ore. Duplicate placement of the same ore in different slots is prevented automatically.\n\nWeight & Maximum (@): Each ore has a target weight shown as ‘@ {maxWeight}kg’. That marks the point where its museum effect reaches the listed maximum multiplier. Entering an actual weight lets future logic scale the effect proportionally below cap.\n\nCurrent Limitation (Version Notice): For now the stats panel uses only the theoretical MAX multipliers (toggle set to Max). The Weight side of the toggle is a placeholder and displays zeros. In a future update, switching to Weight will compute real multipliers based on the weight you entered for each ore vs its max threshold.\n\nModifiers: Selecting a modifier grants an extra bonus expressed as +Xx (its value depends on the underlying ore rarity). Removing or changing a modifier immediately updates potential totals.\n\nOverview (Condensed View): A simplified grouped summary of your museum — one compact line per placed ore under its rarity. It omits all input controls and focuses on: ore name, modifier tag, weight progress (@ target), primary effect (or special multi‑stat effects) and potential max + modifier bonus. Use it for a fast completeness check without scrolling through every display case. Empty museum shows a short informative message instead of a blank panel.\n\nStats Panel: Right sidebar aggregates all museum multipliers by stat. When Max mode is active it shows the sum of maximum potential contributions. When Weight mode is released it will instead sum realistic (current / max) scaled values.\n\nWorkflow Example:\n1. Place your rarest ores first to lock in high impact effects.\n2. Add modifiers to ores whose rarity yields the largest boost.\n3. Record actual weights after mining sessions (future scaling).\n4. Use Overview to double‑check you did not miss a rarity tier.\n5. Revisit after updates to transition from max theory to real weight values.\n\nTips:\n1. Hover mentally on ‘@’ weight: that is your cap target per ore.\n2. Avoid leaving a slot empty in a higher rarity while filling lower tiers.\n3. Don’t duplicate ores— the system prevents it, signaling optimization issues.\n4. Log weights right after mining while data is fresh.\n5. Re‑evaluate modifiers when new ores of the same rarity become available.",
  infoEquipmentTitle: "Equipment Simulation",
  infoEquipmentDesc: "Simulate full equipment builds, apply museum and event multipliers, and estimate final stats before committing in‑game.\n\nPurpose: Quickly compare ring/necklace/charm combinations, tool choices (shovel, pan, enchant) and global amplifiers to plan optimal progression or share builds.\n\nEquipment Slots: The system supports multiple ring slots (shown in the Rings panel), plus one Necklace and one Charm. Selecting an item inserts its maximum roll values (top end of each stat range) to model a best‑case craft outcome. Unequip to clear a slot.\n\nShovel: Adds its fixed dig strength, dig speed and toughness first (foundation layer).\n\nPan: Contributes flat stats (luck, capacity, shakeStrength, shakeSpeed) and parsed passive boosts (Size / Modifier).\n\nEnchant: Applies additive effects after pan so enchant bonuses build on tool base.\n\nCustom Stats: Inject temporary flat values (tests, provisional bonuses) before item gear aggregation so ring/necklace/charm remain clearly attributable.\n\nEquipment (Rings / Necklace / Charm): Added last using max roll from each stat range (optimistic upper bound).\n\nMuseum Integration: Toggle (Max / Weight). Currently only Max mode functions (uses maximum theoretical multipliers). Weight mode placeholder returns 0 until scaling is implemented. Formula: finalWithoutEvents = base + (base * museumMultiplier).\n\nEvents: After museum, each active event multiplies the already adjusted stat (multiplicative stacking).\n\nComputation Order (Updated): 1) Shovel 2) Pan 3) Enchant 4) Custom Stats 5) Equipment Items 6) Museum Multipliers 7) Events.\n\nReading Values: Percent stats (Speed / Boost) show %; others are flat numbers. Museum multipliers stored as decimal fractions (0.25 = +25%).\n\nWorkflow Example:\n1. Pick shovel & pan (base activity profile).\n2. Add enchant to layer targeted boosts.\n3. Insert temporary custom stats if testing scenarios.\n4. Fill jewellery slots with candidate items.\n5. Switch museum to Max for peak projection.\n6. Toggle events to reflect current/session buffs.\n7. Export or note final sheet.\n\nTips:\n1. Re-evaluate after real (non-max) item rolls to avoid overestimation.\n2. Keep custom stats minimal—use them only to model external sources.\n3. Snapshot (screenshot) before altering rings to compare variants.\n4. Track differences by changing one layer at a time (e.g., swap pan only).\n5. Once Weight mode arrives, compare Max vs Weight to plan realistic grind.",
  infoEquipmentStarsTitle: "5★ / 6★ item tiers",
  infoEquipmentStarsDesc: "Item cards for Rings / Necklace / Charm let you toggle between base 5★ stats and optional 6★ stats (when an item defines an extension).\n\nRings: Each ring slot has its own 5★/6★ switch, and the Rings header provides a mass toggle to set all rings at once.\n\nCalculations: The selected tier is fully respected in base stats, museum application and event multipliers. If an item doesn’t have a 6★ extension, its 5★ stats are used.\n\nTip: In selection dialogs, when a 6★ range exists, it’s shown in brackets to the right of the 5★ range.",
